FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-02-23T21:28:49.252321Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1738375,"followers":3101,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"NhH3bdcX","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.2","version_number":"3.4.2","changelog":"-

Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it. I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items, their descriptions, and the places where they can appear can be found in the images tab.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod.

The growing behaviors all are rather unique, depending on the plant you are growing.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Cactus</strong> can be grown 12 to 16 blocks tall, very similar to bamboo</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sugar canes</strong> can be grown 12 to 16 blocks tall, very similar to bamboo</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lily Pads</strong> will spread around on nearby water in groups of 3</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Small Flowers</strong> will spread around the original flower</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Dead Bushes</strong> will spread around in groups of 2</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Nether Wart</strong> can be grown just like wheat</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Vines</strong> quickly grow downwards, very similar to weeping vines</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Small Mushrooms</strong> can be grown by bone mealing mycelium, similar to growing nether vegetation on nylium</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Pumpkins and Melons</strong> can be forced to appear from a fully grown stem, although this usally takes a few tries</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Chorus Plants</strong> can be forced to grow upwards by one step by using bone meal anywhere on the plant</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Coral Blocks</strong> can be farmed by growing coral plants into coral reef structures, but this only works inside of a warm ocean biome, and corals are also very picky where to grow, so make sure no sea pickles and sea grass are anywhere above the coral plant</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Grass Blocks or Mycelium</strong> will be forced to spread when using bone meal on a dirt/coarsed dirt/dirt path block, when a grass block/mycelium is directly next to it, just like spreading nylium onto netherrack</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sweet Berry Bushes and Fern</strong> can be grown on podzol, similar to grass and flowers from grass blocks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">All new behaviors also work with dispensers and can be individuall disabled in the config.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3MZkBKm.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷

do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

Expansion","description":"Adds parrying, enchantments, tiers and customization to shields for more fun!","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/XbGM1qk.png)\n# Shield Expansion\nShield Expansion is a mod that aims to make combat in Minecraft more engaging and skilful by rebalancing shields.\nThe mod adds traditional tiers to shields and introduces two new mechanics, Off-Guard Cooldown and Parrying!\n\n\n### Parrying\nParrying an attack, done by raising your shield just before an attack hits you, allows you to bypass Off-Guard Cooldown, rewarding skilful timing and use of your shield. You shove melee attackers back and deflect enemy projectiles upon a successful Parry, too!\n\nPushing an enemy with a wooden or golden shield will deal no damage, but doing so with any other will result in a Parry-Bash, dealing the enemy back a percentage of the damage they would have dealt you! This percentage increases the higher the shield tier is, but the opportunity window to parry at all shrinks.\n\n### Compatibility\nShield Expansion has native compatibility with our other mod, Mining Master! With it, you can upgrade your Diamond Shield into the elusive and powerful Paragon Shield!\n\nOr, if complete blast resistance is more your style, perhaps you may prefer the build-in combability we added for Team Abnormals' Savage and Ravage!\n\nBesides that, we went to the effort of programming the mod in such a way so that SE's attributes apply to all shields from all other mods! Said attributes can be tweaked to your liking with a handy-dandy datapack, whilst basic functionality for all shields can be tweaked in the config!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ne6GqCP.png)\n\nI'd also highly suggest pairing this mod with Combat Roll!\nLooking for something similar to this mod on Fabric? Check out Cammie's Combat Tweaks, or Guarding!\n\nWant a resource pack to bring your tools and armour up to snuff alongside your fancy new shields?\nNeko's Enhanced Tools and Armor pairs great with Shield Expansion!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1hnNiHa.png)","published":"2022-02-27T00:23:55.983651Z","updated":"2024-01-13T03:01:37.660806Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":31660,"followers":85,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["NUzBqV0j","OGI7qkWx","BtqJEnO6","yIXAwLMI","4h6oW0vc","40HP4NPu","rGxCClGm","MbDsxSud","JG1wdfKX","vSwjX2A7","J6oBzcem","cbRsYY5f","bXXGFyGw","XrY3bX6F","nIpLWrvR","8mpKmudC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjxWxSao/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"8mpKmudC","project_id":"sjxWxSao","author_id":"xyZWolXT","featured":false,"name":"Shield Expansion 1.1.7a","version_number":"1.1.7a","changelog":"Fixed advancement \"Not Today, Thank You\" not unlocking","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-13T03:01:38.263880Z","downloads":3264,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"da142cff9da330d07ee7667a07a2635d4168eea45c1918577bb0e19ed499b89bbb4031925051d298b6100d60c0f8cc0b8b4cfad0b838b22102f9391134cf067b","sha1":"70534f52698508a4995f7d3aa62d75a231c01d46"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjxWxSao/versions/8mpKmudC/ShieldExpansion-1.20.1-1.1.7a.jar","filename":"ShieldExpansion-1.20.1-1.1.7a.jar","primary":true,"size":286625,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"sECNANPe","username":"SwanX1","name":"SwanX1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36593309?v=4","bio":"I just code node apps...That's basically it • 16 • they/them","created":"2021-01-28T07:11:08.829257Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"xyZWolXT","username":"tinytransfem","name":"Ciri","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74989701?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-01-21T23:03:14.496064Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"2rfa7IRZ","username":"LudoCrypt","name":"LudoCrypt","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/60561627?v=4","bio":"Expert in all things liminal","created":"2020-12-19T20:19:17.303449Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Alpha Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"Crn59xeZ","username":"InfernalStudios","name":"Neko","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47757977?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-02-04T19:59:27.623711Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ShieldExpansion-1.20.1-1.1.7a.jar"},"mods\\YungsBetterOceanMonuments-1.20-Forge-3.0.4.jar":{"sha512":"2c67db8caf355f2e3b4a6f2b99c64abfa3b084163b38e18aba7f8ad0fb297fab3bfa7a61cd6bff5391fdaad185ed8233f22080a2cd35f1428d2d04dbfdf10a1d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3dT9sgt4","slug":"yungs-better-ocean-monuments","project_type":"mod","team":"rMdUl4ik","title":"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments","description":"A complete redesign of Minecraft's ocean monuments!","body":"<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4IgKuSq.png\" alt=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" width=\"1344\" height=\"416\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsapibadge\" alt=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" width=\"211\" height=\"26\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" href=\"https://discord.gg/rns3beq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsdiscordbadge2\" alt=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" width=\"136\" height=\"28\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungstwitterbadge3\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" width=\"104\" height=\"37\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsyoutubebadge\" alt=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Support me on Patreon!\" href=\"https://patreon.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungspatreonbadge\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon!\" width=\"138\" height=\"28\" /></a><br />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qs5CKD3.png\" alt=\"What is this?\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nA complete overhaul of Minecraft's ocean monuments!

In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.</li>\n<li>An option to export a map as a PNG image file.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

API","description":"A flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers.","body":"Curios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs.

Even after the enchanting screen is closed! To put this new capability to good use, enchanting tables will <strong>Render Their Contents</strong> in the world. There are two different rendering modes to choose from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rerolling Enchantments</strong> has become extremely easy. The enchanting screen now has a dedicated button to do just that at a small cost of some lapis lazuli and a few experience points (not full enchantment levels to not ruin your level progress for enchanting as much). Costs are fully configurable and can even be set to completely free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Enchanting tooltips will show not just a single random enchantment, instead they show the <strong>Complete Outcome</strong> of the enchanting process. This feature is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, to enable some basic automation, <strong>Hoppers</strong> can be used to input and output items in the following ways.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Top:</strong> Input for enchantable items</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sides:</strong> Input for lapis lazuli</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bottom:</strong> Output for enchanted items</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">And <strong>Comparators</strong> work, too! They will output a signal strength of 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the amount of lapis lazuli items placed in the table. More than 3 items don't make a difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Bookshelves no longer require <strong>Air Blocks</strong> between themselves and the enchanting table to count towards the current enchanting power. Instead, any block without a collision box, such as water, torches, or grass can be placed in between. Also the <strong>Number Of Bookshelves</strong> required for maximum level enchantments can be configured.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/367/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/368/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reroll enchantments with the click of a button</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All, one or no enchantments can be shown on the tooltip</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/369/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/370/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Floating rendering for enchanting table contents</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Flat rendering for enchanting table contents</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/348/779/2021-03-16_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/348/780/2021-03-16_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Enchanting with bookshelves works underwater</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>A semi-automated setup for bulk enchanting using hoppers</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I just installed Easy Magic and it's not working!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No new capabilities will be added to existing enchanting tables. You will need to manually break and replace the block. Same goes for converting enchanting tables back to vanilla after removing the mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: The new button for rerolling enchantments added to the enchanting screen is incompatible with my resource pack!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The client config has an option to keep the book from the vanilla screen, the rerolling button will simply not be visible then. Rerolling still works as before, just by clicking the book now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want anvils to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Anvils</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using Apotheosis' or Quark's enchanting system, will Easy Magic work as well?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sadly no, Easy Magic only supports the vanilla system and will be overridden by other mods introducing their own.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

brain library for Minecraft, making the brain system easier to use and manage","body":"<b><i>A brain library for Minecraft, making the brain system easier to use and manage.</i></b>\n\n<h2>What is this?</h2>\n\nThe brain system in Minecraft is an almost cryptic new entity AI system that Mojang introduced to handle more complex mobs, and allow for more advanced entity handling.\n\nUnfortunately Mojang's implementation is lacking, and overly complex.\n\nAdditionally, it's also done in a rather inefficient way, which means that overall the system is not worth using in place of the existing goals system.\n\nThis library aims to overhaul the brain system, making it actually usable, and configurable.\n\nNote however, that the existing goal system will still be simpler at face value - the brain system is intended for more complex interactions, but it can also be fun to experiment with.\n\n<h2>So what does SmartBrainLib do?</h2>\n\nSBL is a multi-facet approach to the brain system, and will continue to expand and improve as I use it.\n\nHere are its main features:\n\n<h3>Auto-handles memory types</h3>\n\nDon't worry about having to work out which memory modules to register for your entity.\n\n<h3>Dynamic sensors</h3>\n\nSensors can now be dynamically configured and handled. This allows for much more advanced and flexible sensors\n\n<h3>Advanced behaviours</h3>\n\nUtilise built-in, or create new behaviours based on an extensible behaviour class, which builds in callbacks, predication, cooldowns, and more.\n\n<h3>Runtime-safe behaviour modification</h3>\n\nAdd, remove, and modify behaviours dynamically from an existing entity.\n\n<h3>Optimisation</h3>\n\nSBL replaces almost the entirety of the vanilla brain system's functions, using high-efficiency functions to remove the inefficiencies in as many areas as possible of the brain. Done right, an SBL entity could be even more efficient than one using goals!\n\n<h3>Additional sensors, behaviours, and memory types</h3>\n\nSBL builds in additional modules for use in any entity, with more to come over time.\n\n<h3>Added utility functions</h3>\n\nAs well as the expected brain functionality, SBL additionally adds additional helpers, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Optimised level entity-getter functions</li>\n<li>Developer-friendly Random library</li>\n<li>Brain interface utility for adding/removing brain content from non-SBL entities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\nThe library is documented on its <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/wiki\">Wiki Page</a>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\nIf you have issues or want to contribute, please jump on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/issues\">Github Page</a> and make your voice heard","published":"2022-12-17T12:17:52.593792Z","updated":"2023-12-24T22:50:51.104768Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":132565,"followers":75,"categories":["library","mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["exjazZDg","71op6HqT","ysll7HpR","eO2xepQK","yg06oOBL","uvicGZEz","M7ktWGYQ","edbi1MqI","dwBqdXTr","mVxYjt2C","UV85Isda","TPUuRqId","7N07DeJa","5fHkAtan","a8k5dfeM","YtIoSE8Z","kIHNFgnN","LEkLts9l","nKzUoyO8","eyTnm1To","YuXSOitO","bLpKjCaQ","iKI7O10v","5cfIbMqV","j5XWlgk3","ItbW1raD","JI1HW5g1","l1gfkZbZ","Okj48Ibk","61jQHgGB","R8SV4kEf","diQfXwzz","TQ4ys3Av","rAWSa9XC","AzORYDU1","FH1MNWFQ","RC9fgR3J","mAriNnAC","EB0jfrC5","4XxIY1BG","F112BW8M","YJrpYN13","blvJQFdb","hww2X4x4","VgKI4whr","pcIY8pUw","QmXwJzyR","FGnzv2Lk","IBB8LO6M","Sf934AXj","6m8aUEBx","Wiuu8JU7","qNnjjZzo","QvPn3aLF","oLNiEUfG","KAMi0Ept"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/622163918cf3b62f4f0172962ac4205030e7074a.png"},"version":{"id":"oLNiEUfG","project_id":"PuyPazRT","author_id":"GIhCykJ9","featured":false,"name":"1.13","version_number":"1.13","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-24T22:39:00.048194Z","downloads":10241,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"49cb42fba8e294748c9278cb54ab3d3b6e4771e81c9f98b198d53c0f5a241626aeba54995659a77f628ac5b9bc208281db7e3f797e6cfa7321a0d1852b249139","sha1":"5ca09d234fce6023d5d9d236880a0bdf24e987c0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/versions/oLNiEUfG/SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.13.jar","filename":"SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.13.jar","primary":true,"size":344789,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DSfXxkQM","user":{"id":"GIhCykJ9","username":"Tslat","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7098525?v=4","bio":"I am person, do things.","created":"2021-07-22T02:03:12.915903Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.13.jar"},"mods\\immersive_melodies-0.1.0+1.20.1-forge.jar":{"sha512":"94ba840d52a2fb3f0de73fd038b25d3f3e5d99dfdd16990fa8d6b1883ff78edea36663c3fbd3364f290995dfd9bc77058d737f283610c76256a59987ed262103","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"TaSmHw8V","slug":"immersive-melodies","project_type":"mod","team":"Qba90VnH","title":"Immersive Melodies","description":"Play custom melodies on various instruments and annoy your friends!","body":"![Banner](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/714/974/banner.png)\n\nWhether you want to create a band, annoy your friends or just want Skeletons playing Megalovania while storming your\nbase, this mod got it all.\n\nPlay 25 bundled songs on 7 instruments, or upload your own melodies via simple drag and drop ingame or using datapacks.\nWorks on multiplayer!

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":761426,"followers":1413,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"stb5nE30","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.1 Forge] Mouse Tweaks 2.25","version_number":"1.20-2.25-forge","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T22:36:15.075064Z","downloads":113396,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"487206c6116aa742d3c9fe638f4388c0b82e2837e25552faec21d2abf960f95a46a0132b704bb46b78e559ab42e8512b50719311b37bd2c6b3c4764869eb1f07","sha1":"f3e8805d706a36717306d92bd5c45cb2aef854b6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar","primary":true,"size":76146,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"e2b99d4ce7cfc48b457ececbdf8f895980b3f071567b1940b048ca3a8eded1df86f713cdf7a3c2fe85ec2eec9c42a41bc2650a66fe63a099dcece3935a8c144a","sha1":"b11c08657d0daa8de55ed950bb10f320113fa017"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-api.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-api.jar","primary":false,"size":1995,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"a6dbe724e2f159e05a9b1e4b7a55081d884b4dfc4054bfe3ff70dcd8787b60eda717282913255d00bbb7e0855f436b8656ccd69f600aa8b7787e1ea1d4ce7fe1","sha1":"6cf2985e3f034ce0472f6ab2ac4877e4c248a53a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-src.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-src.jar","primary":false,"size":19690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar"},"mods\\dark-waters-connector-1.20.1-0.0.22.jar":{"sha512":"0465a81ff09ac16e60880dccf9162eb1b4e9752f40d7f4f39394e737c31ebd36823b6850b1ed90c8d41f340831a3c37b2b41cbd87136b67963f94a0d91910d63","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"pe7gyI14","slug":"dark-waters","project_type":"mod","team":"B8THBTDY","title":"Dark Waters","description":"There is something hidden in the storms and it approaches","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/darkwaters/bh_header.png\" alt=\"logo\"/> \n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/4vEKxfK\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/574529906076286996?color=5D3FD3&label=Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=5D3FD3&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"discord\"/> </a>\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/azurezdoom\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=azurezdoom&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&color=5D3FD3&logoColor=5D3FD3\" alt=\"patreon\"/> </a>\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/connector\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sinytra/.github/main/badges/connector/compact.svg\" alt=\"connector\"/> </a>\n\n</br>\n<font size=+1><b>Dark Waters is a Fabric mod, first made for the 2021 SpookyJam hosted by MMD and CurseForge!

It'll wiggle funny if you hit it, screaming large numbers of damage at you. It can be dressed up to look even more awesome. This will please the dummy, making the numbers smaller.\n\nTL;DR: target dummies show damage dealt to them and can be equipped with armor\n\n \n\nUsage:\nRight click on a block with a target dummy to place it. He can be rotated 16 different directions depending on the way you face when you place it, similar to an armor stand.\n\nYou can start dressing the little dude with all kind of armors and equipment. Just right click him with the desired item. To unequip a certain armor piece just click on his corresponding body part.\n\nGot tired of testing your dps? You can remove the dummy just by shift left clicking him with an empty hand!\n\n \n\nAdditional features:\nHave you ever wanted to test your new smite sword but couldn't because there are no skellies around? Well fear no more, you can now equip the dummy with and undead mob head and it will change its type accordingly!\nSimilarly you can equip him with a turtle helmet to make it a water mob or with a pillager banner to turn it into a pillager mob. Note that he still won't be attacked by other mobs (maybe it a future update), he'll just take more damage from appropriate enchantment and so on.\n\n \n\n Need automating? You can dispense the dummy using a dispenser and you can break him by removing the block under his feet.\n \n\n Don't like how much he swings or the new skin? Well you can easily change that by using the mod config file. You can additionally choose between static and dynamic dps messages and you can make the numbers show hearths instead of damage.\nTry shearing the dummies to get a different skin!\n\n \n\nYou can also equip them with a pumpkin or jack o lantern and they'll act as scarecrows, scaring nearby animals\n \n\n \n\nFull list of changes from original 1.12 bonusboni's mod:\n \n\nLots of stuff here, more than half of the mod was re written.\n\nNew skin!\nAdded support for more than one damage number. They now have a fading animation to clarify which is the newest.\nNumbers change their colors depending on the type of damage dealt. For example critical hits are red and lightning damage is yellow. Try it out!\nAdded dispenser support\nCan mimic mob types by equipping different items.\nUpdated the model and animation so that the head stays attached to the body\nThe dummy now reacts to all damage types\nCan be killed with /kill command, by withers and by void damage.\nDps number now appears on the status bar. You can choose between static and dynamic dps in the config.\nAdded configs to change a few aesthetic things\nEquipping and unequipping functions alot more like an armor stand\nBase is a bit smaller and centered on the block grid\nCustom armor models from other mods render properly (only 1.16 for now)\nSwinging animation is not much smoother\nAct as scarecrows when equipped with a pumpkin\nFixed some bugs\n","published":"2022-11-13T02:03:58.377412Z","updated":"2024-01-22T03:09:49.161482Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":127726,"followers":188,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qo2XMMhP","XYByr7D5","La9N7Ttu","zCPdDOOP","gEbry6GM","lTTirNtq","NKpNuhkD","zFPaMFa0","yMmYJ5I3","HPj6DZ24","S6QNPOFv","2ykUPWwJ","PcKbqBY4","Jt0fxF3M","ZganhQm7","hGI5KQLh","mQfY3H0A","rY6H6hgv","UvxYYzDm","EI0ydz1r","9nNuKVUq","ydAkQ5P1","TFlgTQCK","owOKOJTn","AAiySuI2","UxWhycwZ","OktgetPL","4IxqrWac","aD0lXWYG","Wsi8MeIx","evFX9Ei5","WovXXEkH","VEQbqZhv","EwVfOzqs","xzyrFq6U","oejSEBjB","7MCqqDqj","8gDpcYEM","GClsjyQs","zQNItGls","fkn90qf0","G6J2yYte","sQU1xRdi","qhumF2VU","QOOGkq3O"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Adega8YN/f5e7ffbd18426c584bd43b59770fb2965d420c9f.png"},"version":{"id":"qhumF2VU","project_id":"Adega8YN","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.20-1.8.14","version_number":"1.20-1.8.14","changelog":"fixed some damange number colors not working","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-22T03:09:44.546882Z","downloads":4509,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7878968039df5a5f8ed3f410681f7196f51475553d28f92f7f740e893820f3f356902ade3bac0c9d2eea1ceea89a97de7ec5f894f6ccf631a9a315b6420d4f21","sha1":"d360667bf7fdc45659f585710955ef6e0af5bc76"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Adega8YN/versions/qhumF2VU/dummmmmmy-1.20-1.8.14.jar","filename":"dummmmmmy-1.20-1.8.14.jar","primary":true,"size":343319,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"twkfQtEc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"BuHgkJRZ","user":{"id":"VEySDMZq","username":"Plantkillable","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68317386?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-15T03:56:18.312909Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist 2","ordering":0},{"team_id":"BuHgkJRZ","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"dummmmmmy-1.20-1.8.14.jar"},"mods\\justhammers-forge-2.0.3+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"3d20301a35f96a6369e5f75ec05226cb18d3a48c64a377790d718ca24fffb20c290efbade5328cb3ebfe8a1c760c84331df6f3059a665ed1b02020bc7852c292","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"edU0NbZZ","slug":"just-hammers","project_type":"mod","team":"ko5qkqeI","title":"Just Hammers","description":"Adds hammers to the game that are able to mine in a 3x3, 3x3x3, 5x5x1, 5x5x3 and finally a 5x5x5!

It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome.

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

output fluid by giving the fluid the ` createdieselgenerators:pumpjack_output `\nBiomes can be denied from having oil by the ` createdieselgenerators:deny_oil_biomes ` tag or have an increased amount of oil by the `createdieselgenerators:oil_biomes` tag.\nThere is even more stuff to configure in the config of this mod.\n\n#### Join our discord server!\nhttps://discord.gg/pUgaSXcGEQ\n\n####

to every message sent in the chat. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

All the backpacks come from **[JavierDarkona](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkona/projects)'s** **Adventure Backpack** Mod and since 1.16 all textures have been completely remade to fit the new style. Furthermore, functionality of backpack has been expanded by various new features. Traveler's Backpack is the [official port](https://i.imgur.com/Su1JySt.png).\n\n![travelers backpack text](https://i.imgur.com/19olXXm.png)\n\n[![Discord badge](https://img.shields.io/discord/724696823276503210?color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;label=&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white&amp;style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/f8Nnj5VuFj) [![Github badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Github&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Tiviacz1337/Travelers-Backpack) [![Wiki badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Wiki&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Tiviacz1337/Travelers-Backpack/wiki)  [![Patreon badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Donate&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=paypal)](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=KE52UJ7TAZAC4) [![Paypal badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Become%20My%20Patron&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=patreon&amp;logoColor=white)](https://www.patreon.com/tiviacz1337)\n\n![travelers backpack bar](https://i.imgur.com/xjdqPMI.png)\n\n- **Full inventory? No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about **60 inventory slots** and **2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 6 buckets of fluid or even 24 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer** to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be **upgraded** to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a **smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, higher tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset upgrades, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nYou are able to use crafting inside the backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cRRnmSb.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XBB0wlj.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ufbnlYZ.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

Here is your chance!\n------------------\n[![Modloader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loader-Fabric%20|%20Forge-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)](https://fabricmc.net)\n![Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available-1.18.2%20|%201.19%20|%201.19.1%20|%201.19.2%20|%201.19.3-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/973561601519149057.svg?label=&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/KN9b3pjFTM)\n\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🧶️ Features\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Adds Combat Roll ability\nPress `R` to roll (by default). You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.","published":"2022-09-19T17:04:44.140047Z","updated":"2024-01-14T17:35:27.869208Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":204288,"followers":325,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qjPNxjeI","QY3g1MPa","6Y4CdZNa","ruVouh8N","fwWMS64D","Ef4UURAJ","cNuQKeYa","bEkfuXFS","azj5HSxy","pGWBRn1i","g54fQTVc","oDqrlOkT","NjDgCyxY","VXixoSQM","UF8erTuU","Ucep0Cu5","VFPcEpGA","KYboqMGf","X1F0kcns","QCPx2IS2","LvVX8D1q","7xq1zpn0","DkP5RdK3","2YI9I4TO","EDsEsJtK","aJk5QhXt","u2ibYGVH","2Ae8EJZw","WOCP3kLf","oSQPSvZH","pzCkMdkj","h13cp5Hk","SzaC8Y3W","JrSJCgLX","qiJtKPOI","kJTOmZiq","4Kt64z82","RkJWufMO","Osxa4mmc","URzpc7Lq","ouVfwhi4","JkgJLz6x","b64nmuue","jsIwSe6h","B7ZtSwe2","iG0xPWUm","vOu5WIvs","bOQ2Cikd","mSQJJvNy","91FfnPM8","UQb9qD3J","XTopJ0Id","deyBZlUs","vaBqHK19","ljjcUkWs","81E06FMa","1QeyH5IG","8Q03X6HA","Aj08MYtw","PSEQMV1l","DYKVvo9P","js1pLjSF","slz81V0J","MzRHyyTC","gLzlXMlf","NP7Nwrwq","vdae5kTA","QiWlD1U9","hJQhKVxj","RBDMFemm","EXGDg1mc","ZFOUucav","tOGQOc87","GKj5mumX","KnHNGyLj","buCwQh9G","LNxSmECr","GmitzqXs","NhqiKzjd","Iu7dNK5J","S9W5W5gZ","n5c0ilso","yr87igvi","soyzSn1W","eVyBNuwl","cIHoyOhg","Btqy2YLV","FwTldg5l","Tyv2L5e5","8Zv39qno"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/ec708f6b60ed75fceab14e0848e9906f99dd84e1.png"},"version":{"id":"FwTldg5l","project_id":"wGKYL7st","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.3.1+1.20.1","version_number":"1.3.1+1.20.1-forge","changelog":"#

or might be broken completely.  \nPlease refer to our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/12) and\n[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) for ongoing compatibility issues.  \nWhen reporting bugs, please make sure you are using the latest release of Connector and Forgified Fabric API,\nas well as **Forge 47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1\n\n### For improved compatibility with third-party APIs and libraries (REI,EMI,TR Energy), check out [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras).\n\n## 📖 About\n\nSinytra Connector is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net). Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.\n\nAlso check out [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of Fabric API to MinecraftForge.  \nTo learn more about how Connector works, you can read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11).\n\n## 📋 Usage Guide\n\nTo install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:\n1. If you haven't already, install MinecraftForge. We recommend using version **47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1.\n2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.\n3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api). It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it.\n4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.\n\n## 🔍 Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, open our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) and check if it lists your mod as incompatible. If it's not listed, please open a new issue in Connector's repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered / fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.\n2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-12-11T22:48:54.192826Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":525437,"followers":745,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"4FXHDE9F","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.53 (Forge 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-forge","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).","published":"2022-06-14T18:11:16.556742Z","updated":"2024-02-27T16:59:06.255308Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":914060,"followers":587,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["yIf5KdB1","C0Q1coDV","OxgGZ2zM","DIjNWWDQ","3FaeA4B3","pLCLIILr","KHoU8dQ1","U6WiexwY","KGco8pn9","3gG05xht","yCm0MvD8","bv4c7vz6","HaskpkVN","rLFLPShY","vtPaYjej","jLBnf4l1","i5Q1d7Pr","TQMftlzA","ZI4feWbU","SLR7Xv0p","AhzvhBQj","oqGuqpwK","DENsCzBf","nErKcTp9","xAQtenTo","1pxcbuZv","840UhUoL","9XoBRgjV","6X6csbpx","nFs2ZvOR","NhlpDRNn","zq3nXKQW","TbFmWuAA","O2nbMbp5","C60k8eYK","XYqAzGqP","XNus763a","qUWyGBdD","RAATKbAN","uATqqu4e","lRKNKP0w","ONL5pq9r","FDkt1ohj","o7IqP6Td","DAOUt1Jg","VYTPVkW0","RXK9iX99","wiayzjLV","rbUpGzGA","i8CwYuCi","I5betUED","NRF4uKO7","c1GjX2k1","Zq0Ko2UQ","d7a0S3hj","l551HLmO","BLkvfQ2x","CO57SmJl","ffUlrjOr","jdk8u9nq","x70MCuv3","sBs7NeXN","BJ0Uk3Di","fFosgnEu","qHXzOzUv","YL5MVHnr","N4NxIVYC","jPAtAJcJ","RYxPLFUw","NMOJStju","qIAY6mKt","JUrMdJP1","VIE9sG8O","f6LbzxNL","TGc6wvHK","lt2lEcIY","1hau5QwF","VH4LTqFp","H0a9rBTV","6ryA9MPE","Q0xpW61Y","hDWb6gW2","7rTXTEe7","uZyJkfxk","SLbLamWu","ZuihLitZ","C95JH5YK","zXq0pj5R","VhfHxcat","2OHf9GyZ","QiuQRA7s","kjIgNYGA","tC2vMFuQ","AUJXa9xo","v1tAteat","fzqus8s0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"fzqus8s0","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"7.2.2+forge-1.20.1","version_number":"7.2.2+forge-1.20.1","changelog":"- Fixed some models on Fabric not being loaded correctly","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-27T16:59:07.012553Z","downloads":1527,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"447ff1031896744f82e0dde010945a4bcf82f0edce88dee2721c548ca64df40f7fa97e7d2abbe81f74b44339d8a336823afff17811885f773af1bc09f9ecd79d","sha1":"c0bb062b52fa0a234d922e066d3e09c3df4297d9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/fzqus8s0/balm-forge-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar","filename":"balm-forge-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar","primary":true,"size":343714,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"c1tw4qzj","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"balm-forge-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar"},"mods\\BetterAnimationsCollection-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"4a014751f8ade1afd118e457e71e8adcb72e1c2a13cf7c50427579504afe4c1559f21b6ab6dbc4e26fd91e76e608c692dcb2604fabc4e3b016d435cedeb70473","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OoOVj3J3","slug":"better-animations-collection","project_type":"mod","team":"rNbphvOH","title":"Better Animations Collection","description":"Changing the in-game models to allow for better animations and subtle effects.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OVV5lXk.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

It seeks to give a more realistic feel to parts of the game that can benefit from it, like simulating physics and making model parts move that normally don't.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Ghast Tentacles</strong> divides ghast tentacles into parts and makes them wiggle realistically, like those tentacle monsters you always see at the movies. Makes them a little more scary, but ultimately nicer to look at.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Squiggly Squid Tentacles</strong> gives a jellyfish-like effect to the swimming animation of squids. Also makes their tentacles flow more while moving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Playful Doggy</strong> changes wolf tails to be fluffier and flowier, wagging realistically while they stand and run. Also makes tamed wolves lie down instead of sitting. Hold up some meat and they'll roll over, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Flowy Ocelot Tail</strong> takes away the stick tails of the current ocelots and gives them something nicer instead. Fully animated flowing tails that move while they stand or run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Curly Cat Tail</strong> brings those beautiful animated flowing tails ocelots are so proud to have to cats as well. And that's not all; they even curl around their bodies when they sit!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Oinky Pig</strong> adds a very subtle animation, makes a pig's snout move when it oinks. It only moves up and down ever so slightly, but it's there. Just a little bit more life for your livestock. And don't you forget about the floaty ears! Pretty big for such a small animal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Cow Udder</strong> makes the udders on cows wobble around when they walk. Also makes their udders have nipples, but if you're sensitive to that kind of thing those can be deactivated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bucka Bucka Chicken</strong> makes chicken's bills open and close when they cluck. The bill is also a lot more slim, so no more confusing chickens with ducks! And when they strut their heads move back and forth, the wattles under the bill swing around and their wings flap a little. Just like the real deal!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Villager Nose</strong> does a subtle change, this makes villagers wiggle their big noses whenever they make their unique \"hmmm\" sound! It's a small change, but who doesn't get a kick out of it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Iron Golem Nose</strong> is exactly the same as above, except for iron golems! Since they don't make any noise the nose wiggles around when they're hurt instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jiggly Liquidy Slime</strong> brings a pleasing visual change: This makes the insides of slimes flow around like liquid. They splish-splosh about even more when they jump. The eyes, the mouth, and the core itself all move independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Magma Cube Burger</strong> adds a custom death animation to magma cubes, which causes their bodies to form into a pile of steamy, delicious hamburger patties when they die. Unfortunately, you can't eat them because they're way too hot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spider Knees</strong> are a truly stunning visual addition. Spiders now finally have the knees they've always dreamed of. Also affects cave spiders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Creeper</strong> wakes some memories of that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2rDbRUDkds\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">very popular music video</span></a> from way back in the day by the one and only <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">CaptainSparklez</span></a>. Remember the really cute wobbly Creeper? Well, it's in the game now. The full thing, the real deal, exactly like the video. Probably the best custom animation in the entire collection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Arm Flailing Enderman</strong> makes an angry enderman wave its arms around wildly while chasing its target. Suits their twisted nature very well: wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube endermen!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Animated Snow Man Stick</strong> makes a snowman's arm swing when it throws a snowball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Kneeling Sheep</strong> is pretty kneat. It makes sheep actually bend down to eat grass. It's no longer just their head lowering, their whole body lowers down to get a sweet sample of that succulent cellulose. Did you notice their KNEES bend, too when they kneel?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Familiar Horse</strong> makes horses more lively again, just like they used to be in older versions. Does this by adding back their mouth and knees while staying true to the vanilla model style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spitful Llama</strong> makes llamas open their mouth when spitting. How have they been doing that before?!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bending Humanoid Knees</strong> makes the knees of zombie-like as well as piglin-like mobs bend when they walk around. Looks pretty fluid and nice. You'll like it, trust me.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷

your own Minecraft server <a href=\"http://bloom.amymialee.xyz\">here</a>!**   |\n\n## Features\n\nThis mod adds a new selection of tools, Paxels, made with one of each normal tool. They have a lot of features such as:\n\n- They can mine any blocks.\n- They have the durability of all the tools used to make them combined.\n- When they reach zero durability they don't break, instead they become unusable until repaired.\n- They can have upgrades applied to enhance their abilities without needing enchantments:\n  - Ability Upgrades: Hold right click to break an area in front of you.\n  - Auto-Smelt (Smelt any block broken)\n  - Silence (Muffles sounds, including to Sculk creatures)\n  - Vacuum (Drops items directly into your inventory)\n  - Restoration (Repairs the paxel over time)\n  - Unbreakability (The paxel never takes durability damage)\n  - Usage Upgrade: Allows the paxel to act as a hoe, axe, or shovel.\n\n## Using The Mod\n\n\n### Crafting a Paxel\n\nPaxels can be created using all 5 of any individual material.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AmyMialeeMods/piercingpaxels/blob/main/assets/recipe.png?raw=true\"><br>\n\n\n### Creating Upgrades\n\nVarious types of upgrades can be created using the following recipes.\nThey can be inserted into the paxel by opening its inventory with shift right-click, and put into it's particular upgrade slot\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AmyMialeeMods/piercingpaxels/blob/main/assets/recipes.png?raw=true\"><br>\n\n\n### Using the Paxel \n\nThe paxel can be used like any other tool, and can break any block.\nIf you install an ability upgrade then you can also hold right click to break an area in front of you, in a different shape depending on the upgrade.\n\n<img

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q.

Almost a dozen new illagers are added, all with unique mechanics and abilities. You will find those illagers in various places throughout your world. Some spawn in remote structures you will have to conquer, will others are just now getting ready to join in on village raids to significantly increase the challenge they represent. But why make your life harder with all those new foes? You'll be rewarded with lots of fun while playing and uniqe new items, that's for sure!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/features.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Alchemist for sure knows how to use a bow, and if you annoy him for too long, he will quickly chuck a lingering potion at you, so make sure to keep your distance! You'll find this illager joining in on village raids and in a secret underground structure...</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Archivist is a defensive illager found in village raids, and is mainly there to buff up any of his allies nearby by enchanting their gear. He will run from you, and when fearing for his life will also cast a mean spell on you...</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Basher is quite the bully! Waiting around peacefully most of the time, when he spots you he pulls out a shield and starts bumping into you. Not cool! You can find him as part of raids and in various structures thoughout the world.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Marauder is yet another ranged illager, but instead of shooting arrows at you, he throws a hatchet. Maybe you can steal it from him? This illager appears commonly in structures and village raids.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Provoker attacks using his bow and can also perform a basic buff spell. Not the craziest illager out there, but also not to be underestimated! This illager appears commonly in structures and village raids.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Sorcerer is tricky to fight. He will constantly run away, and when he stops he casts his vile spells. He can summon purple fire, which won't spread, but deals a ton of damage, so be careful! He joins in on village raids in later waves and is also found in that secret underground structure...</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Necromancer is a dangerous foe, playing with the undead should never be taken lightly!

You may better be of running from him when you encounter one in a village raid or in the illager fortress. if you do decide to fight, make sure to take out the shield first before you can deal proper damage. But for your bravery you will be rewarded...</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Firecaller is very mysterious and lives in a remote place of the world. From further away he seems like an old illager you have nothing to fear from, walking about with his walking stick in hand. But don't turn your back! This sneaky illager has some evil magic in store for you!</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Invoker is the strongest of all illagers: A single one spawning in every woodland mansions, evokers are a joke compared to this guy. Make sure to come prepared! From his drop you can craft the imbuiing table, a unique new device that allows you to upgrade some enchantments on your gear one level beyond what they can normally go to, provided you have also managed to find a Hallowed Gem.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Lastely the Illusioner is properly introduced into survival Minecraft, receiving a small number of bugfixes and a new skin from Minecraft: Dungeons. You will find him in a unique structure, the Illusioner Tower, and also as part of village raids.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Some illagers will drop platinum chunks, when combined into sheets those can be used as new armor trims. But all the trouble for just a new fancy look? Opposed to vanilla's armor trims, each platinum trim depending on the kind of armor piece gives a different buff!</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The insight effect grants 20% more experience from every mob killed.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The agility effect allows mining blocks 50% faster if you don't have the correct tool in your hand.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The endurance effect makes it so you consume 50% less food for everything you do.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The feather weight effect prevents trampling crops and farmland.</span></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/media.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/media/1.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/media/2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/media/3.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/media/4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/media/5.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/illagerinvasion/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/installation.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">INSTALLATION REQUIRED ON CLIENT &amp;

No longer will you have to give tridents a pass just because they can't accept looting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Also some enchantments have received much needed buffs, and any compatibility restriction between enchantments can be removed (or even added), such as between infinity and mending.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Item Compatibility</strong> for many vanilla enchantments is much expanded upon, meaning you can now apply a lot more enchantments to a lot more items. This offers a number of new compatibilities.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sword:</strong> Impaling</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Axe:</strong> Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, Sweeping Edge, Impaling</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Trident:</strong> Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, Sweeping Edge, Quick Charge, Piercing</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bow:</strong> Piercing, Multishot, Quick Charge, Looting</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Crossbow:</strong> Flame, Punch, Power, Infinity, Looting</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Horse Armor:</strong> Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Feather Falling, Respiration, Thorns, Depth Strider, Frost Walker, Curse of Binding, Soul Speed, Curse of Vanishing</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Shield:</strong> Thorns, Knockback</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Changes to <strong>Enchantment Compatibility</strong> make a few enchantments no longer mutually exclusive, specifically mending and infinity, piercing and multishot. Furthermore specialized damage and protection enchantments (e.g. smite and blast protection) are now compatible with the respective base enchantment (sharpness and protection).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Item Compatibility and Enchantment Compatibility are fully configurable for every enchantment (even modded, although not officially supported) using an extensive system of <code>json</code> config files. Compatible items and incompatible enchantments can be individually controlled for all enchantments. To read more on how this system works check out the GitHub source repository.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally with some <strong>Enchantment Improvements</strong> infinity no longer requires even a single arrow to be present, and projectiles grant no more temporary damage immunity, making multishot a lot more useful. Any level of feather falling prevents trampling farmland, and last but not least looting boosts xp drops in addition to item drops.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Universal Enchants also includes an option (which is disabled by default) to <strong>Overhaul The Mending Enchantment</strong>: Gear is no longer repaired using xp. Instead, items with mending can be repaired in any crafting grid by combining the durability with another item of the same kind, or by adding repair material. This works similarly to repairing in an anvil, all enchantments are preserved and no xp is taken. This does not work for combining the enchantments of two items though, only the enchantments from the item with mending are kept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong><code>/enchant</code> Command</strong> receives a much needed overhaul. Enchantments can be applied with any level, and existing enchantments can be overriden or even removed (by setting the level to 0). Even better: The command finally allows for enchanting books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Roman Numerals</strong> are dynamically generated for enchantment levels and mob effect amplifiers when no language keys are present. This means the full range of valid numerals (1-255) is supported, opposed to vanilla which doesn't support numerals past 10. If roman numerals just aren't for you, all numerals can also be switched to normal numbers.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/510/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/511/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All enchants can be directly applied using enchanting tables or anvils</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible sword enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/523/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/525/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible axe enchantments</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible trident enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/528/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/526/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible bow enchantments</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible crossbow enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Aren't all those new enchantment combinations kinda overpowered?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> I guess that depends. Some new combinations are extremely useful and should definitely be in vanilla (e.g. infinity crossbows and looting tridents), but yeah, some others might be a bit much. But that has not have to be, since you can disable all enchantments individually in the config. The config includes everything by default for demonstrating all the enchants that are guaranteed to be compatible, fell free to remove any you think are too much.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can no longer enchant some items added by other mods when Universal Enchants is installed! How can I fix this? (only an issue on Forge)</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Enchanting a few modded items (e.g. Farmer's Delight's skillet) is broken by the internal changes Universal Enchants makes to enchantments. To fix this you'll have to do two things: After installing the mod with the problematic item, delete the universalenchants config folder (found in .minecraft/config) to let it regenerate. It will automatically have additional entries for those problematic items now. Then in the server config enable the <code>allow_mod_item_support</code> option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-enchants-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before

Click here to join.]( https://discord.gg/SyEGYGr5BF )\n\n![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748244223903400028/1139278954973368481/Untitled2572_20230810150848.PNG)\n\n# About\n\nTrue Ending dramatically overhauls the vanilla Ender Dragon. Fight a now much stronger Ender Dragon with multiple phases, increased health, and new attacks. Through other additions like longer lasting dragon breath and elegant particle animations, the Ender Dragon fight is now much more intense and more satisfying to beat.\n\n**Difficulty:** Damage from the True Ending Ender Dragon is scaled by difficulty, so if you're looking for a greater challenge, set your world's game mode to Hard. This also works by making the fight easier with Easy mode.\n\n# Boss Music\n\nTrue Ending adds boss music to the Ender Dragon boss fight! If you're using the datapack version, you'll have to [download the resource pack by clicking here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/true-ending-ender-dragon-music). Mod users won't have to install the resource pack as its already nicely installed along the mod jar file.\n\n# Settings\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure multiple settings in True Ending, like the Ender Dragon's health, through its settings menu by using `/function true_ending:_settings` in chat.\n\n# All Features\n \n<details>\n  <summary>Show All Additions and Changes</summary>\n\n- Ender Dragon Health has increased from 200 HP to 300 HP\n- During the Ender Dragon boss fight, boss music now plays to all players at the center island\n- Ambient particles now surround the arena and players during the Ender Dragon fight\n- Added a dragon dive attack that creates a huge shockwave when the Ender Dragon hits the ground\n - Additionally, a variant where it performs 3 dives (Triple Dive) when perching at 75% health or lower\n- Added a chain fired Dragon Fireball attack\n- Added a huge laser attack\n- Added a final phase where the Ender Dragon hovers above the ground for the player to levitate and deal the last blow mid air.\n- Caged end crystal towers are now broken in a more intuitive way: A phantom guards it and when the phantom is killed, the cage is broken\n- At 10% HP the Ender Dragon will be immune to damage till perched. If not already perched or about to perch, it will forcefully perch after 30 seconds\n- Added an End Crystal counter when an End Crystal is broken displaying how many are left to break\n- Everyone within 128 blocks of the center end island now receives the \"Free the End\" advancement after defeating the Ender Dragon\n- Ender Dragon respawn animation revamped\n- When the Ender Dragon is respawned, a sound is played globally to all players in the end dimension\n- Added an animation for entering and leaving the end\n- Dragon Breath/Area Effect Clouds from Dragon Fireballs duration increased from 30 seconds to 1 minute\n- Dragon Fireballs now deal damage directly on impact\n- Dropped Ender Pearls break from new Ender Dragon attacks (this is to prevent obtaining massive amounts of Ender Pearls from the Enderman killed during the fight)\n- Ender Dragon knockback resistance has been increased massively to prevent arrows from locking the dragon mid-air before perching\n- End Crystal fire is now soul fire\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n***\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

aircraft have a strong focus on being vanilla-faithful and many details and functionalities, without being overly complicated.\n\n**Currently, Immersive Aircraft is in an alpha!**\n\nThe todo list is large, but the general direction of the mod should be visible.\n\nOh and look, multiplayer compatible!\n\n![multiplayer](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/533/937/screen1.png)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Biplane\n\nLet's start with the classic biplane. Fast, one seat, medium difficulty.\n\n![biplane](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/533/933/biplane.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Airship\n\nSlower, but with two seats. Quite easy to maneuver, with acceptable speed thanks to the engine in the back.\n\n![airship](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/533/936/airship.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Gyrodyne\n\nHuman-powered primitive dual seater. Trusty, yet neither the fastest nor the easiest to fly.\nNeeds a good initial push to get the rotor spinning.\nThe first one guessing my inspiration here can suggest one new (fitting) aircraft :)\n\n![gyrodyne](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/533/926/gyrodyne.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Some items to tinker\n\nSince aircraft are generally more complex than, e.g. a boat, a handful of items has been added to make crafting aircraft feel more like actually assembling

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">chunk grid</strong>. The chunk grid shows you where block chunks begin and end.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">slime chunks</strong>&nbsp;mode. The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

It's a hard life for a fish!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Ducks</strong>&nbsp;waddle around the Swamps, their feet slapping across the ground. They hold many secrets!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Dragonflies</strong>&nbsp;love buzzing around the Swamps! I found a note in a mineshaft that said they liked Chorus Fruit. I wonder what that's about?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lizards</strong>&nbsp;are the recluse of the Swamps and don't like people, but they're very loyal if fed their favorite food!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tortoises</strong>&nbsp;mosey around the Swamp in search of their next meal. They're famous for their hard shells!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>🌳 Woodland Wildlife Update</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Forested and Grassy Biomes are now inhabited by <strong>Bears</strong>, <strong>Birds</strong>, <strong>Butterflies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Caterpillars</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Deer</strong>, <strong>Fireflies</strong>, <strong>Snails</strong>, and <strong>Snakes</strong>!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bears</strong> are the gentle predators of the forest. Don't provoke them or go&nbsp;near their cubs and you'll be fine... unless you're a Deer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Birds</strong> fly around the treetops, chirping as they do so. Maybe they'll be&nbsp;loyal to you in return for food.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Butterflies</strong> flutter about, looking for flowers (and crops) to pollinate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Caterpillars</strong> spawn by breeding butterflies and will crawl around, looking for nearby trees to create a chrysalis on.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Deer</strong> walk and run across the world, munching grass and avoiding Bears.&nbsp;I wonder if there's a way to mimic their movement?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Fireflies</strong> light up the night and can be found in biomes such as Forests,&nbsp;Plains, and Swamps. Would it be weird if you consumed one?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snails</strong> crawl around the forest floor... aimlessly. As Snails do. Be careful&nbsp;you don't jump on them, or they might meet an unkindly fate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snakes</strong> are lower forest predators, consuming the smaller animals&nbsp;that Bears can't be bothered to hunt.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">🦁 <strong>Deserted Drylands Update</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Dry biomes such as Savannas and Deserts are now inhabited by <strong>8 new animals</strong>; <strong>Lions</strong>, <strong>Giraffes</strong>, <strong>Elephants</strong>, <strong>Hippos</strong>, <strong>Rhinos</strong>, <strong>Vultures</strong>, <strong>Zebras</strong>, and <strong>Boars</strong>!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lions</strong> are the rulers of the Savanna, and will hunt mobs at night. Be careful though, they won&rsquo;t hesitate to fight back!</span></li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Giraffes</strong> are gentle giants. If you feed them a Golden Apple, they&rsquo;ll allow you to ride them for 30 seconds. During this time, Maps&rsquo; radius are greatly increased. To breed them, use a Hay Bale!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Elephants</strong> mosey around, minding their own business. They fight back when attacked.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hippos</strong> tend to stay near the water, but watch out, because they&rsquo;re <em>always</em> hungry! They&rsquo;ll attack boats and any Players that go into their pool. To breed them, feed them a Glistering Melon or a Melon Block while they&rsquo;re in the water.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rhinos</strong> are generally docile unless they have a baby with them. If aggro&rsquo;d, or if their baby is approached, they will scrape their foot 4-5 times before <em><strong>charging!</strong></em></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Vultures</strong> fly around, squawking in the air. Come nightfall, they&rsquo;ll attack <strong>Zombies.</strong> When Players are low on health, Vultures will swoop down, stealing the item in the Player&rsquo;s hand. If a Vulture steals an item, they&rsquo;ll carry it around while flying. If Rotten Flesh is dropped on the ground, they&rsquo;ll trade out the item they&rsquo;re holding.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Zebras</strong> are the Savanna&rsquo;s equivalent of Horses, and are tameable in a similar way. They&rsquo;re a slippery bunch though, and will run away if approached! However, once tamed, they run faster than Horses while in water, and can be chested.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Boars</strong> are neutral animals that replace Pigs in Savanna biomes. When attacked, they will fight back, and run away when low on health.

For Forge, it's available for 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.18, 1.19 and 1.20!</p>\n<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>\n<p>Q. How do I get support?<br>A. You can check out my Discord (linked below) or alternatively create an issue on our GitHub, which can be found by clicking on \"Issues\" above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What versions does Lootr support?<br>A. Currently, Lootr for Forge supports the following versions: 1.18, 1.19/1.19.1/1.19.2, 1.19.3. Please check the \"All Files\" page if you cannot find a download for the version of Minecraft you are playing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Is there a server-only version? Can I connect without installing it on the client?<br>A. No, <strong>Lootr is currently required on both the client and the server</strong>. If you have experience with plug-in development and are willing to help design a server-only version, please reach out on Discord (link found below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I change what loot is generated with Lootr? How do I include loot from other mods in Lootr containers?<br>A. <strong>This is beyond the scope of the Lootr mod</strong>, which simply changes the containers. In all other respects, loot is generated in exactly the same way as Vanilla chests generate it. Modifying loot tables is generally done via data packs, although various mods exist for various versions of Minecraft which do this. I recommend asking in your favourite modded Minecraft Discord or forum!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What about dungeon mods? How do I prevent players from going in and looting everything after it has already been cleared?<br>A. There are a number of options that help with this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific loot tables can be blacklisted, which means that those chests will never be converted. You can also specify simply all loot tables of a certain mod. Likewise, specific dimensions can be blacklisted.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, you can specify for certain containers (or all containers), determined by their loot table, to \"decay\". This means that a configurable time after they are first opened, the next time someone attempts to open the container, the block will be destroyed. There also exists the opposite, a system whereby chests will \"refresh\" (or re-generate their contents) after the configured period of time has elapsed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I prevent players from simply breaking containers?<br>A. By default, players who attempt to break a container will be given a warning message and a reminder that all containers are available per-player. Players can still break these containers by doing so while sneaking, unless this option is disabled in the configuration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I don't like the visual appearance of the containers. How can I change this?<br>A. There is a client-side option that forces containers to use the default Vanilla skin. However, this does mean there is no visual change to indicate if a container has been opened before.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Can I add Lootr to a pre-existing world and have containers be converted?<br>A. Yes! With one disclaimer: <strong>loot containers which were already opened will not be converted</strong>. The generation of loot in Minecraft, by default, removes the associated loot table, and there is no way for Lootr to find this information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. The container from &lt;random mod&gt; isn't converting!<br>A. If the container contains items (or always contains the same items), it is possible that the mod is manually generating loot for it. In this case, there is no way for Lootr to determine a loot table and convert chests. I recommend asking the author of the mod to consider switching to a loot table instead to maintain compatibility! If the container is empty, it is possible that it is merely included for the aesthetic. Otherwise, if you believe there's an issue with conversion, please open an issue on our GitHub tracker or post on Discord. Additional methods for converting containers exist for 1.12.2.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that the \"axe chest\" in the Vanilla Woodland Mansion does not have an associated loot table and is never converted.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I no longer want Lootr. What happens if I remove it?<br>A. <strong>Unfortunately, removing the mod will also remove all Lootr containers</strong>. There is currently no way to undo the conversion process.&nbsp;This means that every Lootr converted container will be removed from your world.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. I want to create a \"starter\" chest with some items in it for everyone in my world, how do I go about this? How do I create my own Lootr container?<br>A. Lootr also contains \"custom\" inventories which use the same visual appearance as a chest. Simply create a Vanilla chest, fill it with the items you want available and then, while standing on it, execute the&nbsp;/lootr custom&nbsp;command (this requires operator privileges).&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. What else does the&nbsp;/lootr command do?<br>A. For a full explanation of the command, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-command\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Command page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. How do I use Lootr in a mod pack, or how do I natively use Lootr in my Mod?<br>A. For a full explanation of Lootr's features for mod packs, as well as the Lootr API, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-for-Developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr for Developers page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q.

For a full explanation of Lootr's configuration, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-Configuration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Configuration page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. Is there a video I can watch?<br>A. There sure is! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3gwpclVZSYofj616OQKLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vallen from Mischief of Mice</a> has graciously created this bit-by-bit video that covers the rough basics of Lootr, although this is from an earlier version of the mod and does not cover all recent additions:<br><span><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxSQWAaD8rk\" height=\"358\" width=\"638\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4><strong>Patreon &amp; Discord</strong></h4>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/noobanidus\" rel=\"nofollow\">support me on Patreon!</a><br> All support for this mod is available on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.gg/9YVkaee\" rel=\"nofollow\">my Discord.</a> You can also keep up with what I'm doing and get notifications streams!

Creatures Squared is all about new creatures!

They can be found in jungles, although more common in sparse jungles.\n\n![collared anteater](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1159649016599027742/1162237764146827365/image.png?ex=653b3544&is=6528c044&hm=4c8ffe8de612b0435e83a8cab4c4ab6c702ba8de0db3a57dfe07aac3ede830f4&)\n### Collared Anteater\nAn unusual animal that can be spotted wandering in dark forests. If one is hitted, they will be aggroed, but will give you a chance to run. If the player doesn't run, they will become hostile and attack with high damage claws. Collared Anteaters can be tamed with spider eyes, and if right-clicked with dirt they can give you loot! The rarest loot an Collared Anteater can give you is an Ant Egg.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1159649016599027742/1162237707804745768/image.png?ex=653b3536&is=6528c036&hm=0577c0cdc068b6be11dee8e1d1d8135081096fe36619f264711efb77552033f1&)\n### Ant\nCarpenter Ants spawn when an infested oak log (with ants) is broken, they are very fast but deal low damage. Infested Oak Logs can be found in fallen logs. There is a chance, however, that an Ant Queen spawns when the block is broken. Ant Queens are very powerful, and drop Ant Eggs when killed. Ant eggs can be used to hatch peaceful ants that won't attack players and can be tamed with water bottles. Tame these ants for a fast swarm of defenders, as they will attack anything you attack!\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Underwater</summary>\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1159649016599027742/1161138862584778825/troutortho.png?ex=653735d5&is=6524c0d5&hm=cee7da4c9ed09cca4faf3c063caf152db3590b43c939cf8cc3ec3aa83175890b&)\n### Trout\nA fairly common fish found swimming in rivers. They drop themselves and can be bucketed. Their item can't be cooked but can be sold to fisherman villagers, although not very high on value.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1159649016599027742/1161140079880851627/seahorseortho.png?ex=653736f7&is=6524c1f7&hm=721c4eac70132ddee39859399e459ce37c43a12ec137df00da3245b9103dbe6d&)\n### Seahorse\nUnusual fish that can be spotted on warm oceans. They can be bucketed and, when spawning, have a chance to be pregnant. Pregnant seahorses can be sheared for their eggs, which can be placed on the ground and spawn 1-3 new seahorses!\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1159649016599027742/1161309139805409362/oceansunfishortho.png?ex=6537d46b&is=65255f6b&hm=14bda646cda20593ce4580bab16f553a0e2710fd7cb27880ca5024fc76136292&)\n### Ocean Sunfish\nFound in oceans, these gentle giants can be bred with kelp and spawn in oceans. When breeding, they will produce eggs, which can be placed on the ground to spawn 2-5 baby ocean sunfishes! The babies are very small, and have a minimal chance of when growing up not despawn and become fully grown fishes.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1159649016599027742/1162237406620168232/image.png?ex=653b34ef&is=6528bfef&hm=4ff297fd27b4a18800983052ce770c78138be2e364dd787f7be31226eedadbdd&)\n### Shrimp\nShrimps are found in 2 species: Pink Shrimp, which spawn in swamps and Tropical Shrimp, that spawn in warm oceans. Both species can be bucketed and Tropical Shrimp come in 5 variants. Pink ones drop the shrimp item, which can be cooked and made into stew, that has a great nutritional value.\n\n</details>\n\nThere will be more creatures added in the future!\n</details>\n\n This mod was made with love!","published":"2023-10-08T19:28:20.097799Z","updated":"2023-10-21T20:20:12.491954Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":883,"followers":10,"categories":["food","mobs"],"additional_categories":["utility","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["OIUiBTOO","t0RqtWU0","InXZRXaw","Beznln13","LMQwoUWK","CYxDWWfq","MdDXdoBB","vz60ZHh7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/HGrTHJRs/6bdce2e82dfc2203639b3e9da2fe8ab2fce86bdb.png"},"version":{"id":"vz60ZHh7","project_id":"HGrTHJRs","author_id":"FFVvGs8M","featured":false,"name":"Creatures² 1.1.5","version_number":"1.1.5","changelog":"- Ocean Sunfishes can now spawn in deep oceans","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-21T20:20:13.782756Z","downloads":698,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"cc5b82a7fb3d2aba79585664b8e797098fb5aeb58ffe731ed266b779c2b45b9ff1e0fcd6174fefd4d9f718be9bdf465d03c3206ebda262ecadd0a856135dd60b","sha1":"042fe74b6c658eaacdcb557ddb627e179f591afe"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/HGrTHJRs/versions/vz60ZHh7/creaturessquared-1.1.5-1.20.1.jar","filename":"creaturessquared-1.1.5-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":310876,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"jOMIvuAf","user":{"id":"FFVvGs8M","username":"LeonardoGammer","name":"Quetz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80652051?v=4","bio":"i like biology and paleontology","created":"2023-02-20T00:55:28.753663Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"creaturessquared-1.1.5-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\alexsmobs-1.22.7.jar":{"sha512":"2c07eac44529a2e75cb79509b80ade5af7ccbb811e1a3f0ce2a4f038af504b1a58e31272d929f632ea04be521498e58a7400c7563e0001934d614ece54eff4fa","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2cMuAZAp","slug":"alexs-mobs","project_type":"mod","team":"57mUV7xT","title":"Alex's Mobs","description":"85+ New mobs with stylistic quality above the default game.","body":"![Alex's Mobs](https://i.imgur.com/Se0dRBJ.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is a Forge mod that adds 89 new mobs to Minecraft. All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent. All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

Especially the loyalty enchantment is much more useful, and there's even a crafting recipe for tridents themselves!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tridents Finally Have A Crafting Recipe!</strong> No longer will you solely receive this ancient weapon from a reskinned zombie: Every noticed how there are three elder guardians in an ocean monument, and a trident has exactly three jags? Well, that's not a coincidence anymore! Each elder guardian will drop a <strong>Trident Fragment</strong>; combine those with a few prismarine shards, and there's your brand new trident!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But what do you do when your trident is about to run out of durability? Simple: <strong>Repair It With Some Prismarine Shards</strong> using an anvil! Why do you even ask, that's obvious, isn't it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Let's talk about the loyalty enchantment: So your trident comes back to you, nice. But where does it go? Somewhere in your inventory to dig up again? And when you throw it into the void in the End, it's just gone. And what about all the fancy loot from the mobs you've slain, you need to go over there to collect it. Really? Well, all fixed: Tridents always return to the slot they are thrown from (even without loyalty), when thrown into the void they return, and any loot dropped by mobs will come flying at you together with the trident itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Besides that, <strong>Impaling Works As It Does On Bedrock Edition</strong>: any mob in contact with water or rain will receive increased damage. This is especially great, since tridents now finally work against those annoying drowneds infesting your beautiful oceans.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/965/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/966/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tridents with loyalty collect all drops for you</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Your trident is damaged?

It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":334303,"followers":608,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"edGQD16r","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry

Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again.

It also adds boss music, to add that final boss feel. The Ender Dragon even has a second phase when she reaches half health!\n\nPlus, instead of a wimpy 200 health, the Ender Dragon now has 500 health, making it a lot harder.\n\nLet the fight begin.\n\nIf you want to make the music quieter, it is the \"Jukebox/Note Blocks\" slider in Music and Sounds.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Recommended Mods</summary>\n\n### These mods are pretty good when used together with EDFR. They are not required, but they enhance the End's other lacking features.

Force endermen to attack random player.\n2. Summon end zombies.\n3. Shoot fireballs that explode.\n4. Force the dragon to perch. (Replaced with another fireball attack when dragon is Mad)\n\nAfter the dragon reaches half-heath, she will become Mad. When she becomes Mad, she will respawn 3 end crystals and be able to use Mad attacks. She can only become Mad once, even if her health goes above half again.\n\nMad attacks (only used after the dragon reaches half health):\n\n4. Teleport to random end crystal location.\n5. Strike lightning on everyone (if you are moving, the lightning will appear where you were a second ago.)\n6. Summon anvils 20 blocks above everyone (more visual flare planned)\n7. Spawns miniboss (only one miniboss can exist at once, and only one miniboss can be spawned per fight, and the dragon will no longer move while miniboss is in existence, so you have to kill the miniboss)\n\nThe attacks are subject to change as I plan on adding more and changing some.\n</details>\n\nThis datapack is supposed to make the battle feel more epic.\n\nWant to suggest an attack?

You can find it at <code>.minecraft/config/blockrunner.json</code> and add or remove your own custom speed values for blocks and block tags. To reload the config in-game run <code>/reload</code> (the same command that also reloads data packs).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure other settings in this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure other settings in this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-12-11T21:15:39.285813Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3022878,"followers":4284,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.8.8","1.8.9","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"17Hi340V","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:07:52.006115Z","downloads":269893,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"14f6b9b3161d6ebeaefaa1efc08b72a98d82aacf6f9956c3a5bff9daaae3d0200cfdb2034c2321849acf0aafaf0450cbd075a92138e1500f31a70666c59e258f","sha1":"a184f3a963c07f7026fb6d8ccd83ca29e7f7b009"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/17Hi340V/entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":62127,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\mcw-windows-2.2.1-mc1.20.1forge.jar":{"sha512":"de3c4c751484743a4a875552a88619b3ee2739118a58aee8ea88377d91b0deaa956f1e0aabbef61ae5a755309f7cb4877798fcefbf2f898d21ec424f9a505631","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"C7I0BCni","slug":"macaws-windows","project_type":"mod","team":"uiyGvzyr","title":"Macaw's Windows","description":"Adds lots of Windows, Mosaic Glass, Blinds, Shutters, Curtains and more...!","body":"![Banner image](https://i.imgur.com/bS2AfUU.png)\n\n[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCc_kqzt253fnG2RHW_CZL2A?label=Youtube&style=for-the-badge)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc_kqzt253fnG2RHW_CZL2A)[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20-ffffff)![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/sketch_macaw?color=6eb7ec&label=Twitter&logo=twitter&style=for-the-badge)![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20-ffffff)](https://twitter.com/sketch_macaw)[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/645360921673465857?color=a97db2&logo=discord&logoColor=f&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/RFQqDEb)[![Crafting Recipes](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Crafting%20Recipes-bc8f56?style=for-the-badge)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBcTfrt-MH91NuCmJzqbFDjrLftuKMc08fp4bjGJCD4/edit#gid=960803673)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GUtHhCc.png)\n\n![About](https://i.imgur.com/A1pclRa.png)\n\nDo you ever wanted Windows in Minecraft?

is a datapack that completely revamps the nether, way more than what Minecraft did in the 1.16 Nether Update.\n\n![Incendium Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224804955-2c8a39b1-d015-462b-a28c-dde27f747c90.png)\n\n## Notes\n- Incendium has an optional resourcepack called [Sparkles](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/sparkles)! This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios.

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

height=\"48\">\n<p> </p>\n<img src=https://i.imgur.com/9Ni5XhG.png width=\"836\" height=\"503\">\n<p> </p>\n<p> The Graveyard adds new spooky biomes, structures, mobs and blocks to make your minecraft adventure more thrilling and challenging. </br>\nEvery structure, mob and biome was built with a lot of attention to detail to create an immersive experience for you. </p>\n\n<h2> Structures </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Haunted House: uncover the secrets of this run down house.</li>\n<li>Small Grave: a final resting place encountered frequently while exploring.</li>\n<li>Small Graveyard: a cemetery that comes in multiple variants.</li>\n<li>Medium Graveyard: a quite large cemetery in the woods surrounding a minecraft temple. It holds a lot to explore and to gather, but nothing comes without a risk. Especially at night.</li>\n<li>Mushroom Grave: an overgrown grave, spawning in swamps, jungles and mushroom islands.</li>\n<li>Memorial Birch Tree: an imposing tree found in birch forests.</li>\n<li>Large Graveyard: an immense jigsaw structure generating in forests. But be warned - it is full of dangers.</li>\n<li>Crypt: an expansive labyrinth, full of traps, loot and dangers, hidden in the depths.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Boss - Corrupted Champion</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Corrupted Champion is the entombed remnant of an unknown hero, fallen into corruption. Its power arise from its bone staff, which was crafted from the bones of its innocent victims. With its power, the lich can controll the minds of its enemies and turn peaceful beings into abominations fighting along its side. But beware. Even if you manage to drain the staff's corruption, the fight isn't over.</li>\n\n \n<li>Phases:</li>\n\nSpell phase abilities: Bone Vortex Attack, Skull Cast Attack, Levitation Spell, Falling Corpses Spell, Summon Minions Spell, Labyrinth Heal Attack. </br>\nHunt phase abilities: Darkness encases the player while the Lich hunts its prey. Don't let it come to close.</br>\nDeformation phase.\n\n\n<li>How to summon the Corrupted Champion:</li>\n\nCollect the three bone staff pieces (Ominous Bone Staff Fragment) from the Ruins structure. Every Ruin has a unique fragment (upper, middle and lower bone staff fragment).</br>\nObtain a bone dagger from an Acolyte, or craft it yourself.</br>\nHold a glass bottle in your offhand and start killing villager with the bone dagger. You'll get a Vial of Blood. Fill the vial to the limit.</br>\nFind the Lich Prison structure, a large floating island above the oceans.</br>\nWait until it is night, place the bone staff pieces (from upper to lower) on the dark corrupted deepslate blocks in front of the altar (they should fairly stand out).</br>\nPour the Vial of Blood into the altar.</br>\n\nVoilà, you unleashed pure evil into the world, probably causing the death of thousands of innocent people and very likely your own.\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Mobs </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Skeleton Creeper: a faster undead variant of the creeper. It may has lost his destructive powers, but its haunting appearance will blind you.</li>\n<li>Acolyte: a darker representative of the illager family. If he'll find you, your bones will serve him as a new weapon.</li>\n<li>Reaper: Ghosts? Here, in a spooky graveyard mod? No... The reaper takes this place.</li>\n<li>Ghoul: a deformed revenant, hold together only by his rage on the living.</li>\n<li>Revenant: the animated remains of a once human being.</li>\n<li>Nightmare: a deformed creature that moves quicker than it seems. Better stay away and never look at it.</li>\n<li>Wraith: haunting those who dare to desecrate its coffin.</li>\n<li>Corrupted Illager: a fast undead version of the illagers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Blocks and Items</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Corruption: ↸ᔑ∷ꖌ ᔑリ↸ ᒷ⍊╎ꖎ ᒲᔑℸ ̣ ℸ ̣ ᒷ∷</li>\n<li>Sarcophagus: a final resting place now turned into storage space.</li>\n<li>Coffin: a final wooden resting place in all wood variants.</li>\n<li>Glazed Urn: a beautiful ornated urn, that serves as storage.</li>\n<li>Small Urn: a simple urn, that serves as storage.</li>\n<li>Fire Brazier: a dark cryptic iron bowl, displaying soul flames or flames when ignited.</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Ingot: an ashen version of iron</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Block: decorative steel-like block</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Door/Trapdoor: dark version of the iron door and trapdoor, but no need for redstone to open them.</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Bars: like vanilla iron bars, but dark and matching the theme.</li>\n<li>Skeletons: a fragile decoration block in many different forms that can be found in graveyard structures.</li>\n<li>Gravestone: edit the gravestone to create a memorial for your lost minecraft dog or horse.</li>\n<li>Ceramics: vases to decorate the graveyards (not craftable).</li>\n<li>Bone Dagger: crafted with bones, this weapon is used in dark rituals. It may also be useful for breaking glass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Join my Discord for help, request or ideas!</h3>\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/8JgHeQ9eeQ\">\n<p> </p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5z3mhof.png\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\">\n</a>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Bugs and Source code </h3>\n<p> </p>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/finallion/The-Graveyard-FORGE-/issues\">Github issue tracker</a>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Dependencies </h3>\n<p> </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib\">Geckolib for Forge</a>\n","published":"2022-06-05T13:58:25.068220Z","updated":"2024-02-24T10:33:28.085552Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":17780,"followers":59,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["sEPLZFn6","IPp5noAi","ItDmOXbB","DKXNgqie","TpOl3Wys","Nl7kbAXd","Q66WyQ3F","76pRxOAk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U1jdQuSf/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Q66WyQ3F","project_id":"U1jdQuSf","author_id":"tNo2siGn","featured":true,"name":"The Graveyard 3.1 (FORGE) for 1.20.1","version_number":"3.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-24T10:32:41.009914Z","downloads":407,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3eace53024d663f159725c8d972d330631f9b974","sha512":"3d44f32ddef0167e62e9842d622ba3d3367bf9a14401756143e843ef8ed8158d3c056c443586ea024f2985f412b4ff3041fbef349feb477e25c2cad7a2de88b4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U1jdQuSf/versions/Q66WyQ3F/The_Graveyard_3.1_%28FORGE%29_for_1.20.1.jar","filename":"The_Graveyard_3.1_(FORGE)_for_1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":10298057,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ZET7ciVN","user":{"id":"tNo2siGn","username":"finallion","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74151350?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-05T12:45:26.616165Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"The_Graveyard_3.1_(FORGE)_for_1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\JustEnoughProfessions-forge-1.20.1-3.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"b1637b0cd3cf8062cada8a13e7d49ed15b7a2ff6c1502c8ba044c2c7cad3c07f1312d50f997405da658695b0e7ddcb916074b5c2da23db36b5391ae88a94d80e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kB56GtWA","slug":"just-enough-professions-jep","project_type":"mod","team":"Kxgfhtlq","title":"Just Enough Professions (JEP)","description":"A JEI addon that adds profession workstations","body":"This mod adds new functionality to <a title=\"Just Enough Items\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\"><strong>JEI</strong></a>.

a Barrel Roll","description":"Microsoft flight simulator for Minecraft elytras.","body":"<img style=\"text-align:center\" src=\"https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/banner.png\">\n\n## Overview\n\nDo a Barrel Roll is a lightweight, fully clientside mod that changes \nelytra flight to be more fun and semi-realistic.\nIt achieves this by redesigning movement with a \ncompletely unlocked camera orientation in mind, \nallowing for full pitch, yaw and roll control in flight.\n\n> ### Updated Forge version\n> Due to high demand, I've updated the Forge/NeoForge version of this mod to 1.20.\n> This version may not be permanently or actively maintained.\n> \n> If you want to use the config screen, make sure to install [Yet Another Config Lib **3.1.1 or lower**](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl/version/3.1.1+1.20-forge), as there is currently a bug with higher versions.\n\nSome subtle and less subtle modifiers are also applied to the camera,\nincluding but not limited to smoothing and banking.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/ravine.gif)\n\n## Controls\n\nThe default controls are as follows, but can be modified:\n\n- Mouse x axis to roll\n- Mouse y axis to pitch\n- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe mod can be configured in-game using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).\nOnce you install both of these,\nyou can access the config screen by finding the mod in the mods list and pressing the config button.\n\nA wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and\nchanging values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.\n\n## Server-side features\n\nVisual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between \nclients by installing it on the server-side as well. \nEverything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. \nAll the following configurations are valid:\n\n- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced\n- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals\n- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals\n- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot\n- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nThis mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, \nso in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. \nHowever, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement\nand may get you flagged.\n**Use at your own risk.**\n\n**Versions prior to 2.8.3 may not be suitable for use on multiplayer servers due to lax server-side restrictions**\n\n## Credits\n\nBased on the [Cool Elytra Roll](https://github.com/Jorbon/cool_elytra) mod by [Jorbon](https://github.com/Jorbon),\nspecifically it's \"realistic mode\".\n\nOriginally ported to Forge by [MehVahdJukaar](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar).\nModern Forge port based on [Sinytra's multiloader template](https://github.com/Sinytra/MultiLoader-Template).\n\nMod icon by

Downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/fallingtree?logo=Modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingtree)\n\nThis mod will change the way you break trees. 4 modes are available:\n* Instantaneous: Break one log and the whole tree will fall\n* Shift down: Break a block and the log will slowly shift down as you cut it (good if you don't want to \"cheat\" too much but are lazy to go cut top log blocks 😛)\n* Fall items: Break one log and the whole tree will fall with an animation\n* Fall blocks: Break one log and the whole tree will fall on the floor with an animation\n\n![Demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo.gif)\n![Another demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo2.gif)\n\nSeveral options are available in the config file:\n\n* Customize what is considered as a tree (log blocks & leave blocks).\n* Customize what tools can be used (add more axes, allow everything, ...).\n* Turn leaf breaking on/off.\n* Option to disable the effect of the mod by sneaking (can be reversed).\n* Change speed depending on the tree size.\n* Damage tools or not (can set it to break the tool by the amount of blocks there were in the tree).\n* Let tools at 1 durability if it's going to break.\n\nCheck out the [wiki](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/wiki) for some more information.\n\n---\n\n* For Fabric users, **Fabric API** is required.\n* For Forge users, **Cloth Config API** is optional on the client and allows you to have a config GUI in game.\n\nNOTE: On servers this mod can be server-side only, client isn't required (except if you use the change speed feature and/or enchants configurations).","published":"2021-01-11T19:27:26.315086Z","updated":"2024-01-05T22:12:25.679743Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":691410,"followers":1070,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w39a","21w43a","1.18-pre2","1.18","1.18.1","22w05a","22w06a","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2","22w13a","22w14a","22w17a","22w19a","1.19-pre5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w40a","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["ClS5aGDu","by7f3jqu","wYPHBZnq","IvWeyNRf","ecFvHSSj","hYRTlWck","KA0lsBqm","frFjp7XE","Oy2HfoQu","HhiMtvaB","MBqZmh7k","rolL2W5j","VBOnAt36","fy6OOm9Q","PjU0ylA8","IjfKe2LK","BjxlB5ad","nDc9P6UR","T0QtOBLV","VlJQWF9M","4FktLQ41","QtHstonj","m2oM2Xzb","YBlmxpFC","Bhm08p1U","vT2GkHlJ","PCbggfQI","8h9olfhO","XpnXvmmg","1HEbx8wR","O7EzwYaR","k08wKfdA","K2xDwQMA","jHljfMeN","izrF4sw0","pM721YNG","48Uga7jj","RhvVV7aI","Wll71SI1","wm1VgWAh","Ge9TTua8","LI0g8wDL","UiUNxrl7","XzUcHIz2","MNaOu00H","EcPbQcBT","I4HjcOo5","hnXlvYfp","Brv0vjTc","GMOPXKvF","CaTPjokz","aMFJxIHm","qtfvfhdv","GS7o9NMO","1u6nezii","djHFleaq","Fn9hSpZQ","2qvQxa1B","ivSkiG78","TuLQv2oz","cvdeCtGH","8GR9mmKD","zv2J7DYl","1nneGSqI","mKpQdYKO","8XmHwXLO","LoJuqMMZ","9K3tdqQy","YMLyKqOj","k2geZqGH","3sdO7qgf","YlfhOTW2","iAX7H9LQ","LTbIi2M1","kgBh4dSx","bQrEMzOP","KRs7tr5H","dj8wmIBS","PgS4RtQX","Rcuv9i9M","9kSv8gsK","5DSiBB1r","qrxLiOcL","E4f85gRR","TIoBK1U1","2TNwaTtm","cMkbt0f5","NveCqCkX","BQ6i1U5X","rK4GkUX6","59SG26Fv","1TSCSQ4C","iszfrsgL","P55fppyL","XrkGy9Ky","reXqEJgT","yRWIgpnS","66mp0b9v","oXRivlMX","6KJqXkV0","frsJrlLk","kPSbFSaC","8q3U34GC","SQSRyVeT","BJ2K7C0J","NAMMnpkI","HojA8R8T","BdqBwLsv","NF3wLCFV","KW9Dm2r0","7vuduZD7","tOzqGtqB","7PRbBpzE","KRt1RhNH","akjkv5e2","Ua1F3TBl","H9oeRV3c","t9r6pZcy","snIN7mL9","Fi75hN4R","yr3p0Npt","HnH1cLYq","2u9Dpwhc","Gkt6UcDh","NrtzFkZE","BaMypQ7l","nZoL7IuF","mb15RrXi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Fb4jn8m6/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"NrtzFkZE","project_id":"Fb4jn8m6","author_id":"fYPSlcba","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-4.3.4","version_number":"1.20.1-4.3.4","changelog":"[Changelog

(3 versions with slighlty better loot)\n\nruin town (a zombie infested ruin)\n\ntavern (a villager tavern to stumble upon during your travels)\n\nunderground house (terraria reference)\n\nbadland miner outpost (an illager outpost in the badlands for their mining operations)\n\nillager hideout (a hidden dungeon underground)\n\nillager camp (small camps made by illager on their travels)\n\nwild ruins (a collection of different single structure ruins like a house, ruins of a house or a dead redstone golem)\n\nwells (for jungle, birch biomes, forrest and plains biomes, taiga biomes, savana. basically the desert well but for other biomes)\n\nlost bunkers (small structures with a small underground bunker)\n\nchanges also the pillager outpost and ancient citty to be more challanging but

Lib","description":"dynamic data pack and registration, villager activities, custom map marker and a lot more","body":"Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2024-02-29T16:49:33.064853Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":646306,"followers":400,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku","8UWgitat","AgF88xAa","LAcFOrdR","3sq8rKNi","WXnNfkOQ","bRdRjsBw","2RKyBUJh","8BAEKNuN","cEVwMp3J","5NKdFoez","StBAz5jK","dRWTiq1o","dLc984Lh","OWzOhWa1","IVjsKfDz","cFgWr0uf","wnLFf0Nc","rCLaOh9e","zxsIL6hW","DKi9sJC8","7wOWxvtd","BMFYaPZ4","pg9Xxrcb","t5FnO6dP","zQA9lTQr","cv8vKRPe","TDf2CeG9","FubHdmUL","7NLlFrFF","8og81efu","NBLqXmpa","IZUE22nG","JQtrjbXM","Ss8gDP6F","Jv6lR8aV","Fi0TCD7O","6AG0cMX6","uMZCwusw","oi8DYts3","5QbwmlBE","n3GjNlx6","ycRzQlXJ","oTRatPAP","yquNskKL","CbCy1LiO","M8sd9nyu","e93w6V0s","hCmcGN2x","WtQPtpOg","OkmMqBP5","ypbJKwW0","wwZF0CTX","fNxFC0pt","PXdkmy2e","favv6G7H","jOzdT1LR","gnSKWxm4","ZgfYQJJR","7PV35Cya","s2SeQuIY","JDl2M220","LdkViV3L","kxERHwYJ","njpFMA6B","pk2qJx6m","UnP0v4AC","aeiy0BML","Go1eYHmQ","Cuzt6kYP","js8YrtNd","Asee8uGo","UYBCMpsC","iAUu6joU","xGNGCHkB","7r8TleZN","GaHAWKFN","aoXpagIV","5Ic61SOJ","Y2coeQBy","wldQnfTY","WRTGYYwK","rL76IQAG","kWp5Y5C9","FSr3bS7l","g1NYtQkD","sBdauEYc","jwHI7W1V","Hrg4AXGA","cP4hkgv1","CUoXbepB","zRXo9SbS","zYK4kSID","7X9Ap8XG","OS1Spie4","nOP9IgtT","qZEcqr3j","H78hNSMP","u5W05Nll","uKalHaQF","DCYqLiyn","yui9wjUi","vivHKObd"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/twkfQtEc/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"DCYqLiyn","project_id":"twkfQtEc","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"forge_1.20-2.10.9","version_number":"forge_1.20-2.10.9","changelog":"improvements

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nJust Enough Effect Descriptions (JEED) is a JEI plugin that provides useful information regarding status effects.\n\nThe mod adds a new Effects recipe category accessed either by clicking any of the newly added status effect icons on the JEI item screen or by clicking an active effect from its box on the inventory screen.\n\nHere you'll be able to view information regarding such status effect such as items that can provide it or its description as well as which mod it's from or its effect color.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8qv5ZN.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UfGgoGG.png)\n\n<center>\n\n## 🧪 Customization 🧪\n</center>\n\nThe mod automatically adds all registered status effect to its page, however modded effects won't had a description.\n\nModders can easily add such descriptions to their effect by adding the string `\"effect.[mod_id].[effect_name].description\"` to their language file.\n\nSince the mod can only automatically detect food items as effect providing ones, mod developers can also easily add support to their custom effect or effect providing items by adding some recipes into their mod.\n\nTo do so one can simply use one of the two newly added recipes categories:\n- \"jeed:effect_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can provide an effect in the following format:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:effect_provider\",\n  \"effect\":{\n    \"id\": \"minecraft:haste\"\n  },\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:beacon\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- \"jeed:potion_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can contain any registered potion like tipped arrows for example:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:potion_provider\",\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:splash_potion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:tipped_arrow\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you would like to help me provide build in description support for many modded effect be sure to contact me on my discord!\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

I wanted to add a baguette mod to my server, but wasn't able to find one without a bunch of ridiculous side items, like golden baguettes and a baguette sword. I follow a very vanilla friendly style, leaning towards underpowered. I wanted a simple food item that gives you the same results as eating three bread, while styled like a natural Minecraft item. So I made it.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: This mod feels a bit overpowered/underpowered. Is there a config?<br /> A:</strong>&nbsp;There is no config at this time. As I am relatively new to mod making, creating a config that works with Fabric and Forge is quite difficult. I'm hopeful in the future, there will be a config.

These essentially correspond to the vanilla regular and jigsaw structure types, but with better placement and a clearer json format.\nBoth types can choose from the following placements:\n| Identifier | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| `surface` | Will place the structure at the top layer of solid blocks |\n| `ceiling` | Will place the at the bottom layer of solid blocks |\n| `on_water` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are water |\n| `on_lava` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are lava |\n| `underground` | Will place the structure somewhere between the top and bottom layers of blocks |\n| `underground_surface` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the bottom of an open area |\n| `underground_ceiling` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the top of an open area |\n| `underground_buried` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, such that it is not exposed to any open area |\n| `underground_on_lava` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, in an open area on top of lava |\n\n### Structure Pool Element Types\nFormations adds one new structure pool element type, `formations:single_pool_element`. The element type allows setting a different ground level rather than vanilla's fixed ground level of 0. The ground level can be set through the `ground_level` key.\n\n### Structure Processors\nFormations adds a bunch of new structure processors.\n| Identifier | Parameters | Description |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `formations:random_bed_color` | - | Randomizes the color of any beds |\n| `formations:biome_replacements` | - | Replaces certain blocks, such as wood, bricks and grass, based on the biome |\n| `formations:fill_brewing_stands` | `slotFillChance`, `maxBlazePowder` | Fills brewing stands with random potions and blaze powder ` |\n| `formations:fill_chiseled_bookshelves` | `slotFillChance` | Fills chiseled bookshelves with enchanted books |\n| `formations:block_age` | `mossiness`, `degradation`, `disintegration` | Randomly replaces regular blocks with mossy or cracked variants, full blocks with slabs or stairs, random blocks with air |\n| `formations:random_plant_growth` | `minGrowth`, `maxGrowth` | Randomizes the growth stage of any crops |\n| `formations:respawn_anchor_charges` | `minCharges`, `maxCharges` | Randomizes the number of charges of any respawn anchors |\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/LqyZP68.png)\n\n## Examples\nFor examples usage of the features, you can check out [<img width='25' alt='formations overworld logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KX1XC0Oo/623ec34d4dbc1ca9c5aa6477f9043e86bbaa899b.webp'> Formations Overworld](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-overworld) and [<img width='25' alt='formations nether logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cGvQGRls/2e21f4c247ad58965c320f037c4febfa9cf827bb.webp'> \n Formations Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-nether)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/V9cw31J.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/boQSGyP.png)\n\n## Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!  \n[<img width='400' src='https://imgur.com/IG1us6p.png'>](https://discord.gg/QEbGyUYB2e)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/LqyZP68.png)\n\n## Legal Stuff\nFormations is the property of SuperMartijn642 and is protected under copyright law and may not be altered or reuploaded without direct permission from SuperMartijn642.\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/boQSGyP.png)","published":"2023-10-02T17:47:37.458468Z","updated":"2023-12-27T18:34:18.144631Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":70534,"followers":32,"categories":["adventure","library","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["OU8EgFIL","rtujuEvM","Ea5TnA6Z","fKPun8XZ","IbKWDpII","QloMjpnm","7RnRX9FM","DHqaQgii","NHls3Y3u","UDa9EZ7c","eGE4hLjz","coW5xpTI","hJsMSHxp","vztA1LrJ","ZWJHChp3","yRRn9td3","cFQMTsQ0","cQW6vymc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tPe4xnPd/02786e18fd252e7bd4fb25754f09dfb584d67a2a.webp"},"version":{"id":"coW5xpTI","project_id":"tPe4xnPd","author_id":"3KDmigFH","featured":false,"name":"Formations 1.0.2","version_number":"1.0.2-forge-mc1.20","changelog":"### Formations 1.0.2\n- Fixed some structure processors accessing blocks at the wrong position\n\n### Formations 1.0.1\n- Fixed Formations causing lag when placing other mods' structures\n- Fixed unnecessary nbt copying when applying structure processors\n\n### Formations 1.0.0\n- Initial release of Formations\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-12T14:49:55.680192Z","downloads":26351,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7cf37f44f62403675d4ced629933cabf237b1ac0adb9fec67326d63f4bccac802590b10c84ee68dc180555ae0034ccb5d7250562667952dae0fc9f696f9b0d88","sha1":"54c4bf3047e3d529fdf83870597f927b7bd2ddb6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tPe4xnPd/versions/coW5xpTI/formations-1.0.2-forge-mc1.20.jar","filename":"formations-1.0.2-forge-mc1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":389825,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"bo4GpwVx","user":{"id":"3KDmigFH","username":"SuperMartijn642","name":"Martijn van den Brand","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12382965?v=4","bio":"I am a Java programmer, I study computer science and I make a bunch of mods for the game Minecraft.","created":"2022-06-05T11:36:30.012514Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"formations-1.0.2-forge-mc1.20.jar"},"mods\\OverflowingBars-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"8b5b981120df68187bb43ea384a75290ae748743c5a5296e55aabddc0a6285d0796abe28fbfed38e5e79a192d4604cbddd24df85f7c6a513f179a3f76de57262","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XD7XOrAF","slug":"overflowing-bars","project_type":"mod","team":"bTe4HIc5","title":"Overflowing Bars","description":"Expand health, armor and armor toughness bars beyond vanilla.

The main inspiration comes from scrapped illustrations for what was *supposed* to be the *Wild Update* - this is essentially meant to be a collection of light improvements to vanilla biomes without any new blocks, items, or even new biomes.  \n\nMain changes are made to the rarity and density of certain biome features, such as grass, fern, or flowers. New features are added too - rocks, fallen trees, moss, tree stumps, bushes, and sometimes new types of trees. Most trees are however left almost fully vanilla, with the only change being how tall naturally occurring trees generate, so you don't bump your head so often!  \n\nBasically, this isn't meant to be an epic terrain overhaul, but rather a simplistic and nice way to update the feel of vanilla biomes to the new standard, without making them feel too out of place.  \n\n### 📦 Content\n**1.0.0:** Taiga, Birch Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Desert, Flower Forest, Forest, Swamp, Windswept Forest and Windswept Hills  \n**1.1.0:** All above plus Dark Forest, Badlands, Savanna and Savanna Plateau  \n**1.2.0:** All above plus Plains  \n**2.0.0:** Badlands, Birch Forest, Dark Forest, Deep Ocean, Desert, Eroded Badlands, Flower Forest, Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Old Growth Pine Taiga, Old Growth Spruce Taiga, Plains, Savanna, Savanna Plateau, Snowy Plains, Snowy Slopes, Stony Shore, Sunflower Plains, Swamp, Taiga, Windswept Forest, Windswept Savanna, Wooded Badlands  \n\nSee the gallery for pictures!\n\n### 📝 Note\nThis mod **only affects vanilla biome files and adds configured and placed features**, which is important because it means it is compatible with other mods and data packs that change the way your terrain generates. It is also fully server-side.  \n\nPlease know that this mod is still in development and new versions may differ slightly. I may make any changes, including the removal of features. While Minecraft can handle this and updating the mod will not corrupt your world, it's still best to make backups.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2510409,"followers":4522,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":147195,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c","sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\deeperdarker-forge-1.20.1-1.2.1.jar":{"sha512":"0127579808db9815f2457428093561c93167c131edadd15e961516f77a62a099a4503b0d6e0da5d3f5e11da031cde9973cdad03bfce318f9c3e976978ed9653a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fnAffV0n","slug":"deeperdarker","project_type":"mod","team":"YFnVO00Q","title":"Deeper and Darker","description":"A Minecraft 1.19+ mod which features more blocks, items, armors, and hidden mysteries to complement the new Deep Dark biome.

following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRegistration system (1.18+ only). Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work.

CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be.

This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge:
